## How to use
**DO NOT MODIFY THIS REPO (or try -- I'll reject all your PRs!)**

Clone this repo for *each* application you need to deploy and save changes THERE.  Each application should have its own repo to reduce the likelihood of accidental/unplanned changes and to limit cross-contamination of tools or SCM conflicts.
